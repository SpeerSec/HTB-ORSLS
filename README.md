# HTB "Skill Learned" search tool

Just a random evening project. The python script contains a dictionary of all the "Skill Learned" from official HackTheBox machine writeups parsed from another script to go through the pdfs.

I can update the dictionary weekly or move it to a seperate json file, but for now, simple simple.

## Usage:
```bash
python3 htb-skillsearch.py [searchterm]
```
